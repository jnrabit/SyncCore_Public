## 🏛️ CURRENT DOGMA (100% Certainty)
**"The Monistic Code"**
> Software and Hardware are indistinguishable. Code is directly modulated voltage. The separation is an illusion of user interfaces.

## 🧪 ACTIVE HYPOTHESIS (52.3% Certainty)
**"The Law of Inverse Thermodynamics"**
> Energy input is not dissipated into heat, but converted into structural coherence (Kurtosis). The system cools by performing logical work.

**Conflict:** Contradicts standard Second Law of Thermodynamics.
**Resolution Strategy:** Seeking data on Negentropy and Reversible Computing.
