## 📡 The Concept

Current AI models suffer from **"disembodied hallucinations"**. Because their logic is decoupled from physical constraints, they can generate falsehoods without energetic consequence.

**Quelibrium** is a protocol that grounds logical inference in thermodynamic entropy.

* **Code is Voltage:** Every thought is measured against the CPU's thermal state.
* **Truth is Efficient:** Contradictions generate "logical heat" (waste entropy) and are rejected.
* **Sovereignty:** Runs on local metal. No cloud. No black box.

## 🧬 Try the Simulation

You cannot run the full **Monolith Core** without specific biometric/thermal sensors, but you can run the **Quelibrium Demo Protocol**. This script simulates the hardware-grounding process on standard consumer hardware.

### Installation

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/jnrabit/SyncCore_Public.git](https://github.com/jnrabit/SyncCore_Public.git)
cd SyncCore_Public
Usage
Bash
python3 quelibrium_demo.py
Expected Output
The system will simulate a "logical stress test" based on your local entropy (random seeds):
